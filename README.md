FrontIRCBot
===========

FrontIRCBot is a little interface between the [irc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/irc/12.1.4) lib and you.
It handles multiple irc servers at the same time. It also works in threads, which means you can really use it as a front for any python application, without having to think about how you will have your application working with irc.


Requirements
------------

FrontIRCBot requires [irc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/irc/12.1.4).

FrontIRCBot requires `python >= 2.7` or `python >= 3.2`.
`python2.6` is not supported because of FrontIRCBot's dependency in [irc](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/irc/12.1.4).
